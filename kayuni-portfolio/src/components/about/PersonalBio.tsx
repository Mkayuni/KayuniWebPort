          Aside from being on the computer most of the time or teaching, I have a rich personal life filled with diverse interests.

          I'm an avid reader and enjoy immersing myself in thought-provoking novels. Some of my favorites include "Nightfall" by Isaac Asimov,
          "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien, and "One Hundred Years of Solitude" by Gabriel García Márquez.

          Music is another passion of mine. I love playing the bass guitar and have been practicing for several years.
          The rhythmic foundation that bass provides to music resonates with how I approach problem-solving in technology —
          building solid foundations for complex systems.

          When I need to step away from screens, I enjoy hiking in nature, which helps me clear my mind and gain new perspectives.
          And at home, I'm a proud cat lover who appreciates their independent yet affectionate nature.
